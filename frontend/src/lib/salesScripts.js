  intro: {
    title: "Intro / Opener",
    content: `**Pattern Interrupt Opener:**

"Hey, is this [OWNER NAME]? Perfect — you're not in trouble, this is actually a good call.

I'll keep this quick. I built something that stops HVAC and plumbing shops from missing calls when they're on the job. It answers 24/7, books appointments, and sends you a transcript plus recording of every call.

Most shops are losing $3,000–$10,000 a month in missed calls without even knowing it. Have 60 seconds?"

---

**Micro-Qualification (Add After Opener):**

"Quick question — are you the one who handles the business line, or does someone else pick up most calls?"

*(If yes → they're hooked. If no → you get the decision-maker.)*

---

**Proof of Pain Line:**

"Last week one of our shops missed 27 calls in 3 days during a cold snap. They had no idea until we showed them."

---

**If They Say "Who is this?":**

"My name's [YOUR NAME]. I run a tech company that builds AI phone agents for contractors — we're live in shops just like yours. We're not selling leads — we help you capture the ones you're already missing."

---

**If They Sound Rushed:**

"Totally get it — you're busy. Quick question: if you're missing calls right now while you're on the job, would you want to know? That's literally what I help fix."

---

**Soft Permission (Increases Conversion):**

"If this isn't relevant, tell me and I'll hang up — fair?"

---

**Warm Intro (Referral):**

"Hey [NAME], [REFERRER] gave me your number — said you'd want to hear about this. I built an AI that answers your business line 24/7, books jobs, and sends you transcripts. He's using it and said it's been solid. Got a minute?"

---

**Micro-Close (End Every Opener With):**

"Want me to show you how many calls you might be missing?"`,
  },

  qualifying: {
    title: "Qualifying Questions",
    content: `**Pattern Interrupt Start:**

"Before I go any further — this isn't a pitch. I just need to know if this even makes sense for you."

---

**Discovery Questions (Pick 2-3):**

1. "How many calls do you think you miss on a typical day when you're on a job?"

2. "What happens right now when a customer calls and you can't pick up?"

3. "Do you have someone answering phones full-time, or is it just you?"

4. "When was the last time you lost a job because you couldn't answer in time?"

5. "Are you running any ads right now — Google, Facebook, anything?"

6. "What's your biggest bottleneck right now — leads, labor, or something else?"

---

**Real-World Proof:**

"One of our guys in Phoenix thought he was only missing 2-3 calls a week. Turned out it was 15. He had no idea until he saw the dashboard."

---

**Budget Qualifier (With Soft Permission):**

"Just so I don't waste your time — this runs $249 to $997 a month depending on volume. If that's way outside your range, no hard feelings, tell me and we'll part ways. But if you're losing even one or two jobs a month to missed calls, it pays for itself. Does that math make sense?"

---

**Decision Maker Check:**

"Are you the one who handles decisions on tools like this, or is there someone else I'd need to loop in?"

---

**Urgency Check (Speed to Value):**

"Is this something you'd want to get set up soon, or more of a 'maybe later' thing? I ask because most shops are fully live the same day — sometimes within an hour."

---

**Future Pacing:**

"Imagine knowing exactly how many calls you're getting, who called, what they needed, and whether they booked — all without being glued to your phone."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"Want to see what your call flow would look like with this running?"`,
  },

  "what-it-does": {
    title: "What This Does",
    content: `**One-Liner:**

"It's an AI that answers your phone 24/7, talks like a real person, books jobs, and sends you the full call instantly."

---

**30-Second Version:**

"When someone calls and you can't pick up, the AI answers. It asks what's going on, gets their info, and books them on your calendar. You get a text with the transcript + recording so you know exactly what happened. Nights, weekends, holidays — it never misses."

---

**What Makes It Different:**

"Answering services take messages. This actually handles the call — qualifies the lead, books the job, and gives you everything you need to follow up."

---

**Credibility Anchor:**

"We built this specifically for HVAC and plumbing — not a generic AI bot. It knows your industry, your terms, your customer questions."

---

**Common Use Cases:**

- Missed calls while on a job
- After-hours emergencies
- Weekend coverage
- Busy season overflow
- Filtering tire-kickers

---

**Real-World Proof:**

"Had a plumber in Dallas miss 40+ calls in one month before he knew it. Now his AI catches every single one. He said it's like having a receptionist who never sleeps."

---

**Future Pacing:**

"Imagine never worrying about missing a call again — even on weekends."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"Want me to show you what this looks like in action?"`,
  },

  "how-it-works": {
    title: "How It Works",
    content: `**Setup Process (Speed to Value):**

"We get you live same day — sometimes within an hour. Here's the flow:

1. You sign up and pick your plan
2. We build your AI agent trained on your services, pricing, and tone
3. You get a new number or forward your existing line
4. You connect your calendar (Google, Outlook, Cal.com)
5. You're live — every missed call gets handled automatically"

---

**Speed to Value Line:**

"Most shops are fully live the same day — sometimes within an hour."

---

**If They Ask Technical Questions:**

"It's real-time conversational AI — not a phone tree, not a script reader. It listens, responds naturally, and adapts to the caller. Same underlying tech as ChatGPT, but tuned specifically for service calls."

---

**Credibility Anchor:**

"We built this specifically for HVAC and plumbing — not a generic AI bot."

---

**What You See:**

"Every call shows up in your dashboard:

- Full transcript
- Audio recording
- Caller info
- Sentiment (urgent, frustrated, calm)
- Whether it booked
- Recommended follow-up"

---

**Integrations:**

- Google Calendar
- Outlook
- Cal.com
- Forward your existing number or use ours
- SMS + email alerts
- Zapier for CRM

---

**Risk Reversal:**

"If it doesn't book you jobs, you won't keep it — and that's fine. It has to earn its place."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"Want me to show you how fast it books appointments?"`,
  },

  pricing: {
    title: "Why It Costs This Much",
    content: `**Value Frame:**

"What's one job worth to you — $300? $500? $1,000?
If you miss even 2–3 calls a month, you're already losing more than this costs. The AI pays for itself if it saves you one job."

---

**Cost Comparison:**

"A part-time receptionist is $2,000+ a month.
An answering service that actually books is $500+.
This is $249/month for 24/7 coverage that never calls in sick."

---

**ROI Breakdown:**

"At $249/month, one saved job puts you ahead. Most shops see 4–10 extra booked jobs a month once they stop missing calls."

---

**Real-World Proof:**

"Had a guy in Atlanta who thought $249 was steep. First week, the AI booked a $2,400 water heater replacement he would've missed. Paid for 10 months in one call."

---

**If They Push Back on Price:**

"I get it. But you're already paying for missed calls — you're just paying in lost revenue instead of a monthly fee. This flips that."

---

**Why Not Cheaper:**

"This isn't a call center overseas. It's custom AI trained on your business, running 24/7, booking real appointments. The tech costs money — but it costs less than losing jobs."

---

**Risk Reversal:**

"If it doesn't book you jobs, you won't keep it — and that's fine. It has to earn its place."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"Want to see the ROI breakdown for your volume?"`,
  },

  "plan-breakdown": {
    title: "Plan Breakdown (PRO / ELITE / SCALE)",
    content: `**Pattern Interrupt:**

"Let me break this down simply — no confusing tiers, no hidden fees."

---

**PRO — $249/month**
*Launch & Capture*

"For new operations and solo players getting their first consistent lead flow. Stops the bleeding of missed calls."

- 300 Minutes / 1,000 Texts
- Full AI Command Access (Standard)
- Automated Lead Triage
- Smart Call Routing

*Best for:* Businesses just starting to run ads or getting 10-20 calls/week.

*Speed to Value:* "Most PRO shops are live within an hour."

---

**ELITE — $497/month**
*Momentum & Growth*

"For active businesses that are scaling up and can't afford a single second of downtime or a missed booking."

- 800 Minutes / 3,000 Texts
- Full AI Command Access (Standard)
- Priority Processing Pipeline
- High-Volume Lead Management

*Best for:* Shops running ads consistently, getting 20-50 calls/week.

*Real-World Proof:* "Our ELITE shops typically book 15-30 extra jobs per month from calls they used to miss."

---

**SCALE — $997/month**
*Dominance & Empire*

"For the heavy hitters. Unrestricted volume for businesses that never want to worry about 'limits' again."

- 3,000 Minutes / 5,000 Texts
- Full AI Command Access (Standard)
- Enterprise-Level Data Handling
- Unlimited Location Support

*Best for:* Multi-location or 50+ calls/week.

*Future Pacing:* "At SCALE, you stop thinking about phones entirely. Every call handled, every lead captured, every competitor left wondering why you're always available."

---

**Quick Recommendation:**

- Just starting out or testing? → PRO
- Running ads and getting 20+ calls/week? → ELITE
- Multi-location or 50+ calls/week? → SCALE

---

**Risk Reversal:**

"Start with PRO. If you outgrow it in a week, we'll credit you toward ELITE. If it doesn't work, cancel anytime."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"Based on what you told me, which one sounds like the right fit?"`,
  },

  "upsell-elite": {
    title: "Upsell to ELITE",
    content: `**Pattern Interrupt:**

"Hey, not trying to upsell you — but I noticed something in your account that might save you money."

---

**When They're on PRO and Hitting Limits:**

"I noticed you're burning through your minutes pretty fast. That's a good problem — means you're getting calls. But here's the thing: if you go over on PRO, you're paying for top-ups at a higher rate.

ELITE gives you 800 minutes for $497. That's actually cheaper per minute than buying PRO + top-ups. And you get priority processing, so your calls get handled faster during peak times."

---

**The Math (Proof):**

"Right now you're at $249 for 300 minutes. That's about $0.83/minute.
ELITE is $497 for 800 minutes — that's $0.62/minute.
If you're using 500+ minutes a month, ELITE saves you money. It's not an upsell — it's just math."

---

**Real-World Proof:**

"Had a guy in Houston fight me on this for two months. He was paying $249 + $150 in top-ups every month. Finally switched to ELITE — now he pays less and has headroom to grow."

---

**The Soft Push (With Permission):**

"I'm not trying to upsell you for the sake of it. But if you're growing, ELITE is built for that. You get more headroom, better rates, and you're not watching your minutes like a hawk.

If that doesn't sound right, just tell me and I'll drop it."

---

**Future Pacing:**

"Imagine not checking your minutes every week. Just running your business knowing every call is covered."

---

**Risk Reversal:**

"Tell you what — stay on PRO this month, track your usage, and if you're consistently over 300 minutes, we'll bump you up. No pressure. I just don't want you overpaying for top-ups when there's a better option."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"Want me to pull up your usage so we can see if the math makes sense?"`,
  },

  "upsell-scale": {
    title: "Upsell to SCALE",
    content: `**Pattern Interrupt:**

"I'm only bringing this up because you're past the point where the other plans make sense."

---

**When They're a Heavy Hitter:**

"Look, you're running serious volume. At SCALE, you get 3,000 minutes and 5,000 texts for $997. That's about $0.33/minute — the lowest rate we offer.

You're past the point of worrying about limits. SCALE is 'set it and forget it.' Unlimited locations, enterprise-level handling, and you never think about minutes again."

---

**The Multi-Location Pitch:**

"If you've got more than one location, SCALE is the only plan that makes sense. You get unlimited location support, so you can run the AI across all your shops without juggling separate accounts."

---

**The Math (Proof):**

"ELITE is $497 for 800 minutes — $0.62/minute.
SCALE is $997 for 3,000 minutes — $0.33/minute.
If you're doing 1,500+ minutes a month, SCALE pays for itself. At your volume, you'd actually lose money staying on ELITE."

---

**Real-World Proof:**

"Got a guy with 4 locations in Florida. Was juggling 4 separate ELITE accounts — $2,000/month. Switched to one SCALE account — $997/month, unlimited locations, half the cost."

---

**The Dominance Frame (Future Pacing):**

"At this level, you're not competing with other shops on price. You're competing on responsiveness. SCALE means every call gets answered, every lead gets captured, and you're never the guy who 'didn't pick up.' That's how you own a market."

---

**Risk Reversal:**

"If you outgrow SCALE somehow — which would be insane — we'll build you something custom. But at this tier, you'll never hit a ceiling."

---

**Micro-Close:**

"You're already spending $500+ on ELITE or PRO + top-ups. For another $500, you 4x your capacity and never think about it again. Want me to switch you over?"`,
  },

  objections: {
    title: "Objection Handling",
    content: `**"I need to think about it."**

*Pattern Interrupt:*
"Totally fair — I'd want to think about it too. Quick question though: what specifically do you want to think over — the price, the tech, or just whether this is the right time?"

*(Get to the real objection, then address it.)*

*Micro-Close:*
"If I could answer that one concern right now, would you be ready to move forward?"

---

**"I don't have the budget right now."**

*Reframe:*
"I hear you. But here's the thing — you're already paying for missed calls. You're just paying in lost revenue instead of a monthly fee. If this catches even one job a month, it pays for itself."

*Proof:*
"Had a guy tell me the same thing. First week, the AI booked a $1,800 job he would've missed. Paid for 7 months."

*Micro-Close:*
"What if we could get you live and you saw the ROI in the first week — would that change things?"

---

**"I already have an answering service."**

*Pattern Interrupt:*
"Cool — how's that working? Honest question."

*Reframe:*
"Are they actually booking appointments, or just taking messages? Because most answering services cost more and do less. This books jobs directly on your calendar — no middle step."

*Proof:*
"One of our shops was paying $600/month for an answering service. Switched to us at $249 and books 3x as many appointments."

*Micro-Close:*
"Want to see a side-by-side of what you're getting vs. what this does?"

---

**"I don't trust AI to talk to my customers."**

*Soft Permission:*
"That's fair — a lot of people feel that way at first."

*Reframe:*
"But here's the thing — the AI doesn't replace you. It catches the calls you CAN'T take. Would you rather miss the call entirely, or have the AI grab their info so you can call back?"

*Proof:*
"Had a skeptic in Texas — said he'd never let a robot talk to his customers. Tried it for one week. Now he says it sounds better than his last receptionist."

*Risk Reversal:*
"Listen every call. If you don't like how it sounds, turn it off. No contract."

*Micro-Close:*
"Want to hear a sample call so you can judge for yourself?"

---

**"What if the AI messes up?"**

*Transparency:*
"It might. Nothing's perfect."

*Safety Net:*
"But you get a recording and transcript of every call. If something goes sideways, you see it immediately and can call the customer back. You're never blind."

*Proof:*
"In practice, the AI handles 95%+ of calls without issues. And the 5% that need help — you know about them instantly."

*Micro-Close:*
"Want me to show you what a flagged call looks like in the dashboard?"

---

**"I'm too busy to set this up."**

*Speed to Value:*
"Setup takes less than an hour and we do most of it. You answer a few questions, connect your calendar, and you're live. It's designed for busy contractors who don't have time to mess with tech."

*Proof:*
"Had a guy set this up between jobs. Took 45 minutes. AI was answering calls by lunch."

*Micro-Close:*
"If I could get you live by end of day, would that work?"

---

**"Send me some info."**

*Pattern Interrupt:*
"Sure, I can do that. But honestly — info gets ignored. You'll read it, mean to follow up, and forget."

*Pivot to Demo:*
"The best way to see it is a quick demo. Takes 5 minutes and you'll know right away if it's a fit. Can we do that instead?"

*Soft Permission:*
"If it's not for you, I'll tell you. I don't want to waste your time either."

*Micro-Close:*

  "after-hours": {
    title: "After-Hours Pitch",
    content: `**Pattern Interrupt Opener:**

"Quick question — and be honest — what happens when someone calls you at 8pm with a burst pipe?"

*(Wait for answer)*

---

**The After-Hours Angle:**

"Here's the thing — emergencies don't happen 9-to-5. And when someone's got water in their basement, they're calling the first person who picks up. If that's not you, it's your competitor.

The AI answers 24/7 — nights, weekends, holidays. It handles the call, books the job, and texts you the details. You can follow up in the morning, or if it's urgent, you know immediately."

---

**Real-World Proof:**

"Had a plumber in Denver miss a $4,000 emergency call on a Sunday because his phone was off. Competitor got it. Now his AI catches everything — he's booked 12 emergency jobs in the last month he would've missed."

---

**The Emergency Play:**

"For emergency calls, the AI flags them as urgent. You get a text right away with what's happening. You can call back if it's real, or let the AI book a next-day appointment if it can wait."

---

**The Weekend Frame:**

"Most contractors turn their phones off on weekends. I get it — you need a break. But you're also losing jobs to whoever IS answering. The AI lets you unplug without losing business."

---

**Future Pacing:**

"Imagine taking a full weekend off — phone completely silent — knowing every call is handled and every job is booked. You come back Monday to a full schedule instead of a dead pipeline."

---

**The Vacation Pitch:**

"What happens when you take a week off? Do you just lose all those calls? With the AI, you're covered. It handles everything, books appointments for when you're back, and you don't come home to an empty calendar."

---

**Risk Reversal:**

"If you try it for one weekend and it doesn't catch at least one job you would've missed — I'll personally refund that week."

"Hey [NAME], wanted to share this — one of our shops signed up Monday and booked 6 jobs by Friday from calls they would've missed.

If you want to see similar results, let me know. Happy to get you set up."

---

**Day 7 — Final Check-In (Soft Permission):**

"Hey [NAME], one more check-in. The offer we talked about is still good if you want to move forward.

If now's not the right time, just tell me and I'll leave you alone. No hard feelings."

---

**Day 14 — Last Follow-Up:**

"Hey [NAME], last message from me. If you ever want to revisit the AI answering service, I'm here.

Door's always open. Good luck with the business."

---

**Day 30 — Re-Engagement (Pattern Interrupt):**

"Hey [NAME], it's been a few weeks. Quick question — are you still missing calls, or did you find another solution?

No pitch — just curious. Either way, hope business is good."

---

**Day 60+ — New Feature Re-Engagement:**

"Hey [NAME], we talked a while back about AI call answering. We've added some new features since then — faster booking, better transcripts, SMS follow-ups.

Worth a fresh look if you're still losing calls. Want a quick update?"

---

**Post-No Follow-Up (Risk Reversal):**

"Hey [NAME], no worries on passing. If things change down the road, door's always open.

And hey — if you ever want to test it for a week with no commitment, just say the word. Good luck with the busy season."`,
